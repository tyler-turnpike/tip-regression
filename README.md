Tip percentage is strongly influenced by the size of the bill and the time of service

Insights
1. Focus on Peak Tipping Times: If data shows higher tips during weekends or dinner hours, allocate experienced staff and optimize resources during these times to maximize revenue.

2. Upselling Based on Data Patterns: If larger bills correlate with higher tips, train staff to recommend additional items like appetizers or drinks that align with customer preferences observed in the dataset.

3. Address Low-Tip Segments: If certain payment methods or customer groups tip less (e.g., lunch crowd or card payments), tailor promotions or personalized service strategies to boost satisfaction and encourage tipping.
